In this SQL Project (apart of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program), I was tasked to analyze current usages of smartwear technologies through different data metrics such as steps, hours slept, intensity levels etc... 

The Raw Dataset was acquired through Kaggle and gathered through Amazon's MTurk platform: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dermisfit/bellabeat-data

Data was cleaned through Google Sheets and Graphs were developed in Excel
